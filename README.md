ParserClasses
=============

parserclasses .cpp and .h files created for assignment 2, and used for assignment 3.

Test Cases
==========

We fixed our code to work with all of the test cases contained within the test cases posted on Piazza. It gives correct output for every test case except for stressTestB, where it created 275 tokens instead of 272 as indicated by Eric. Will update on this later, when the number of tokens is confirmed

Using Our Code
==============

Take our parserClasses.cpp and parserClasses.h and use them for assignment3 :)
