ParserClasses
=============

SFU Fall 2014 ENSC 251 Assignment 2 ParserClasses .cpp and .h files! :D

We fixed our code to work with all of the test cases contained within the testcases folder. It gives correct output for every test case except for stressTestB. The number of tokens is currently being debated on Piazza, we will attempt to fix our code to reflect the correct number of tokens as soon as an official response about the number of tokens is issued.

Using Our Code
==============

Take our parserClasses.cpp and parserClasses.h and use them for assignment3 :)
